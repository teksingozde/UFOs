# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The customer wants to create a web page that consists of data related to UFO sightings and that we can filter according to criteria. The web page is prepared with an HTML file, and the colors and texts are formatted with CSS. The data of the UFO study is located at the bottom of the page and in accordance with the filters.

### Resources
#### Software:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


#### Dataset:
- data.js

## Creating Web Page 
The JavaScript files contain the UFO observation data and create a reference using the HTML table element, i.e., the d3 attribute, to be able to observe the data.

The UFO sighting data for the HTML file is formatted with the CSS file in order to be able to carefully pass it to the user, and the layout is provided using Bootstrap.

In general, the way a WEB page is created is traditional for this page as well. At the top, there is a research bar, a title spread over the entire page, a paragraph in the middle, filters in the lower left part, and data in the lower right. Usually, filters are created in HTML format. JavaScript files are called in the HTML section.

Looking at the web page in general, light-colored text is used on a dark background to make it easier to read. Since this formatting is done in the CSS file, all information is included in the body part.

The situation requested by the customer is to allow the user to filter criteria such as city, country, way of being seen, and state along with additional data.

## Results
You can see my web page from this link: https://teksingozde.github.io/UFOs/

The information requested below will be given in detail in the 1st screen shot.

##### Image 1. Filter Search

Looking at the right part of the page, the Filter Search criteria and the output data are on the right.

Columns on the right side of the page; It consists of information such as date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments. It is clearly seen that the information belongs to the year 2010.

JavaScript allows us to filter multiple criteria and get the data as we want. These observation data include the observations in the United States of America and are formatted with white text on a gray dark background.

## Summary

The web page is working properly, and the data is reset if the criteria are completely cleared. A person who enters the site and wants to obtain the data can easily understand and access the data. In terms of design, it has a format that is as simple and easy on the eyes as possible.

In general, the web page structure is suitable for all kinds of starter formats. There are only a few that need improvement. Maybe more colorful and visually more photos can be included in terms of format. Because users always keep and will keep the visual functions before the written and functional resources.

Although the data is for 2010, it is lagging in terms of renewal. As seen in Image 1, although the data is outdated, it has not been updated. Perhaps, a program can be written in which the data will constantly update itself, and today's data can be accessed. In fact, if it is considered that data is being processed every day since 2010, big data will emerge. Users will be able to obtain data from the past to the present and use it in appropriate analyzes and scientific studies.
